Computational input would say:
For school, there's a problem set due Monday (top priority).
For work, there's grading due Monday (medium priority).
For fun, we're having a party Monday (lowest priority).
For family, I have to call my parents by Monday (top priority).

This would output:

PSet for school due Monday
Call Parents for family due Monday
Grading for work due Monday
Party for fun due Monday

Because the things with top priority would be the first
things that the user should do, down to the things that
the user cares the least about (lowest priority) by
days.
