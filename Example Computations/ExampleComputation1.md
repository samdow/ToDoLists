Computation input would say (in some fashion) that:

In Math, there's PSet due Monday (and indicate that's my top priority) 
and a Test due Friday (and that's my lowest priority).
In DSLs, there's a Notebook due Sunday (top priority) 
and a Critique due Tuesday (top priority).
In Anthropology, there's a Reading due Tuesday (lowest priority)
and an Essay due Friday (medium priority).

This might return:

Notebook for DSLs due Sunday
PSet for Math due Monday
Critique for DSLs due Tuesday
Reading for Anthropolgoy due Tuesday
Essay for Anthropology due Friday
Test for Math due Friday

Here, we see that days are more important than priority.
For instance, the person should start the Reading due Tuesday before
they start on the Essay is due Friday even though the essay has
a higher priority.
